Key features of mad 
Great UI (User Interface), Fast loading time and high performance, Extremely helpful user support, Adapts to a user’s needs

Reasons for Mobile App failures
The app doesn’t have a market, The app does not have adequate security, The app does not perform quickly enough , The app does not fully consider UX/UI 

Fundamentals of Mobile Application Development
Choice of technology(Platforms like Android, iOS, windows are evolving rapidly with frequent updates. , These platforms make it practically possible for developers to build unique features)
 Clear recognition of requirements(Define and set your final goals so that you can make a clear strategy , Knowing your goals will help you develop apps that directly satisfy user needs) 
Dynamic functionalities(Different functionalities like GPS, transactions, messages, sensors ,These interactive functionalities are mainly added to attract users)
Security and speed efficiency
Testing quality and consistency
Introduce pilot version

Design tools(prototyping tools)
Invision ,UXPin ,Sketch, Slicy

Android architecture
Applications : home, contact, phone, browser
Application framework : activity manager, window manager, notification manager, recourse manager
Libraries :  media framework, SQlite, webkit,freetype  (Android Runtime :core library, Dalvic virtual machine
Linux kernel :display driver, camera driver, Bluetooth driver, USB driver

Tablets
Ex: Samsung Galaxy Tab, Huawei MediaPad

App types: native, hybride, cross platform, web app
Tools
 native :android studio, xcode, appcode
Hybrid : Ionic, apache cordova, visual code
Cross platform: react native, Xamarin,Flutter

Native Pros:  Full access to device , Powerful performance, Native UI (updating along with the OS), Efficient App Running
Native cons : No multi-platform support, High dev cost if different OS support is needed, No code reuse

Hybrid pros: Lower development cost ,Different OS support, Code reuse, Cost effective development
Hybrid cons: Slower performance, Limited access to OS features ,No interaction with other native apps

Crossplatform pros: Different OS support, UI performance is almost as fast as native, Code reuse, Cost-effective development
Crossplatform cons: Slower performance, Limited access to OS features, Poor interaction with other native apps

Principles of mobile interface design 
Mobile mindset ( Be focused ,Be unique , Be considerate) 
Mobile context (Bored, Busy, lost )
Global guidelines ( Responsiveness , Scrolling , Contents, Controls)
Navigation models (Tab bar, Drill down)
User inputs (Keyboard variations, Auto correction , Device orientation) 
Gestures (Invisible , No replacement , Two hands
Orientation
Communication (Provide feedback , Confirmation and alerts)
Launching 
First impression ( Icon , First launch)

Layouts
Linear Layout :This layout aligns all children in a single direction, vertically/horizontal
Relative Layout: displays child views in relative positions to (Sibling elements, Parent)
Constraint Layout :This layout provide feature to position and size widgets in a flexible way ,Works similar to relative layout but more flexible than that
Table layout
Frame layout
